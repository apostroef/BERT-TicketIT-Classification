<h1>MULTI-OUTPUT CLASSIFICATION (TYPE, PRIORITY, AND QUEUE) OF IT TICKETS WITH HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION OF A FINE-TUNED BERT MODEL</h1>
<h3><i>Overview</i></h3>
<p>this study focuses on a core challenge: how to effectively classify IT support tickets across multiple labels—specifically type, priority, and queue—using a fine-tuned BERT model. The central aim is to investigate the influence of hyperparameter variations and class weighting techniques on the model's performance. By building and optimizing this multi-output classification model, the research seeks to validate its effectiveness by comparing its results against traditional machine learning algorithms, thereby demonstrating the advantages of using a deep learning approach for complex text classification in the IT domain.</p>
